            <h2>Introduction and Statement of Problem</h2>

        <p>
            Of all of the geophysical methods investigated so far, the acquisition, processing, and
            interpretation of seismic observations tend to be the most time, equipment, and
            manpower intensive. As a consequence, compared to the other geophsyical techniques,
            seismic methods tend to be rather expensive. Even though the seismic method investigated
            in this particular project, refraction seismology, is inexpensive compared to some of the
            more comprehensive seismic investigations (i.e., reflection seismic methods), given its
            expense, you will rarely employ even a refraction seismic investigation before doing other, less expensive,
            reconnaissance investigations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the investigations undertaken thus far, the relevant observations have been measured
            by sophisticated instrumentation and provided to the user as a single number: the gravitational
            acceleration, magnetic field intensity, or the apparent resisitivity at some spatial location.
            In collecting seismic observations, no such simple number is provided. In refraction surveying,
            for example, the instrument does not simply display the time required for a wave to propagate
            from the source to a fixed receiver location. Rather, seismic instruments measure and provide
            records of the time-history of ground motion at a particular location. This has two consequences.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, the amount of data collected during a seismic investigation is orders of magnitude larger than
                collected while conducting the other geophysical investigations described. Along with this increase
                in data flow comes logistical concerns regarding data storage and data access that we haven't had
                to deal with in the past. Also, with the increased data flow collected from seismic investigations
                comes a much greater ability to constrain the details of the underlying geologic structure than we have
                seen with the other methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                Second, it is up to the data
                processor or interpreter to determine from the records of ground motion the relevant physical
                parameters; in a refraction survey these would be the times of arrival of particular seismic
                waves.
                Thus, unlike the other techniques, the determination of the relevant physical parameters from
                seismic observations requires human intervention and, as a result, is in itself an interpretative
                process.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Although reliable interpretations from all geophysical observations
            require an accurate knowledge of field parameters, the equipment and logistical scope
            involved in conducted seismic surveys make this issue particularly thorny.
            Extensive field notes, known as <i>OB (Observer) sheets</i>, are routinely recorded while
            conducting <i>ALL</i> seismic investigations.
            The quality and accuracy of these OB sheets can vary greatly and can directly affect
            the interpretability of the observations collected.
            For example, the personnel responsible for the processing and interpretation of seismic data
            may only interact with the acquisition crew through the OB sheets produced during data
            acquisition. If the information included on these sheets is incorrect or incomplete, it may
            be impossible to process or interpret the observations or the final interpretation
            may be biased.
        </p>
        <p>
            To gain a better appreciation of the importance of providing adequate documentation of the
            field activities, the interpretive process that is required to extract travel-time information
            from the field observations, and the noise inherent to all seismic observations, a series
            of shot records were recorded in the <i>CSM</i> survey field using a variety of seismic sources
            and array configurations. With this knowledge, and adequate observer sheets, you should be
            able to determine everything you need about this survey, extract the relevant travel-time
            information, and construct estimates of the typical uncertainties associated with travel-time
            observations.

            <b>Pointed to in the table below are the first three observer sheets from the survey described above.</b>

        <p>
            <b>In writing these field notes the following nomenclature has been used:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="square">
            <li>
                <i>Record Length</i> - The total time duration after the initiation of the source that ground motion
                is recorded,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Sample Rate</i> - Ground motion is not recorded continuously. Rather, every so often the ground
                motion that the seismometer senses is sampled by the recording instrument and stored onto tape. This
                process is called <i>digitizing</i>. Sample rate specifies the time interval, in milliseconds, at which
                measurements are made,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Group Interval</i> - In the context of this particular set of OB sheets, this number specifies
                the distance between geophones,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Src Cnt</i> - Simply an incremental counter of the number of sources initiated,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Reel #</i> - The tape number on which the data referred to is stored,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>First File</i> - The <i>Field File Identification Number</i> by which the data stored on the
                tape is referred,
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Src Loc</i> - The location of the source in station numbers, and
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Comments</i> - This simply contains comments about the particular recording. It may contain
                information on the source, information on noise, or other information the recorder felt was relevant.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                From the OB sheets describe the experiment that was performed. Produce a sketch of the geophone and
                source geometries. What sources were used? Did they all work?
            </li>
            <li>
                List the <i>FFID's</i>, or Field File Identification Numbers, of those shot records that you believe
                will
                contain reliable observations.
            </li>
            <li>

                From the well-recorded shots, estimate the time of arrival of the first arriving
                seismic wave observed at each station. For shot records using the same source at the same
                source location, average the estimated arrival times at each station and compute the
                standard deviation of the observed arrival times.
                Comment on the source/offset variation of these numbers.

                One of the most common methods used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of seismic
                observations is to sum the traces recorded at each station for repeated shots. This process
                is called <i>stacking</i>. Stacking helps to reduce some types of noise, but it can not reduce
                other common types of noise.

                        What do you believe are the most common sources of noise in the shot records
                        given above?<br /><br />

                        Which types of noise can be effectively removed by stacking and which types will not
                        be removed by stacking?<br /><br />

                        For those types of noise that can not be removed by stacking, what would be your
                        recommendation on designing a survey to minimize their effects?<br /><br />
