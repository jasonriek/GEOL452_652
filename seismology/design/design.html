            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Like the resistivity method, the refraction seismic method is employed (usually) as an
            active method. A source of seismic energy is detonated, and the ground motion produced
            by this source is recorded at various distances from the source. As you could see from
            your experience with the resistivity method, the application of active geophysical methods
            generally requires more logistical forethought than the passive methods. By this, we
            simply mean that there is more equipment involved and more survey parameters that must be chosen.
            Because of this, however, we usually have more control over noise reduction and the regions
            of the earth that perturb our signals than we would with a passive method.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the seismic method, we can control even more variables related to survey design than
            we did with the resistivity method. In addition to the configuration of the receivers
            (including spacing and orientation), in the seismic method, the source can be moved independently
            of the receivers and different types of sources can be employed. With all of these variables
            and the expense of the equipment required to collect and interpret the observations,
            seismic methods tend to be more expensive than the other geophysical methods. Thus, reconnaissance
            surveys, like resistivity surveys, are often employed before acquiring seismic data in an
            effort to determine the necessity of doing seismic exploration and to determine the best
            survey design parameters to use when acquiring the seismic observations.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
            There are five learning objectives for this project:
        <ul>
            <li>Begin to appreciate the logistical demands of employing seismic techniques,</li>
            <li>
                Continue to develop an understanding of the various physical parameters and structures
                that can be constrained seismic methods,
            </li>
            <li>Continue to practice and refine your structured decision making and survey design skills,</li>
            <li>
                Continue to develop an understanding of the use of controlled-source geophysical methods and how
                they differ from natural-source methods, and
            </li>
            <li>
                Improve your ability to select optimum survey parameters based on a comparison of expected
                signal strength and noise characteristics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
        <p>
            You are to submit a bid for a refraction seismic survey to determine
            the geometry of water table and the saturated alluvium/bedrock interface beneath the site.
            As defined in the
            <a href="../RFB/rfb.html" target="_blank">
                Request for Bid
            </a>
            , special interest should
            be given to determining 1) whether a sufficient groundwater reservoir exists beneath the site
            to be used for supplying water to the site, and 2) whether the ground under the site is part
            of the Clear Creek watershed.
            You will follow the same procedure we have used for all of the surveys up to this point
            (estimate amplitude and frequency of signal and noise, design a survey to enhance the signal and
            minimize the noise at the lowest overall cost, and estimate the cost of the survey). The following are the
            steps
            that should be taken to complete the bid:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using the results of the surveys performed to date, determine the range of depths and seismic
                velocities (P-wave) that might be found in the alluvium above water table, alluvium below water
                table, and bedrock,
            </li>
            <li>
                Tabulate the sources of noise that will affect the resistivity survey and estimate the amplitude
                of each of those noise sources,
            </li>
            <li>
                Discuss techniques that can be used to minimize the noise from each source,
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the refraction modeling packages pointed to below, produce synthetic refraction
                profiles for the range of depths and velocities expected,
            </li>

            <hr class="gray">
            <li>
                Develop a detailed plan for a survey that can be expected to acquire data sufficient for
                interpretation. Some technical issues to consider include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of profiles to be collected,</li>
                    <li>Choice of seismic source (sledgehammer, shotgun, or explosives),</li>
                    <li>The number of active channels you need in a recording system (12,24,48,60,96,120,etc.),</li>
                    <li>The location of the first active geophone in the spread in</li>
                    <a target="_BLANK" href="../../information/surveycor.html">standard survey coordinates</a>,
                    <li>Orientation of the geophone spread (east/west or north/south),</li>
                    <li>Number of locations in the spread to be occupied by geophones,</li>
                    <li>Distance between adjacent geophones in the spread,</li>
                    <li>Number and location of each source to be shot into the spread, and</li>
                    <li>
                        Like the resistivity survey, remember that you have permission to occupy the client's site
                        only,
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Estimate the cost of the survey you have designed. The economic factors governing the survey include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Recording Costs
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Recording Equipment</i> - Recording equipment depreciates at 1%/day.
                                The cost of the recording system is dependent on the
                                number of channels it can record. A general estimate is $1000 per channel. Thus, a 24
                                channel
                                system costs $24,000, and a 48 channel system costs $48,000. Systems are available that
                                record
                                12,24,48,60,96, and 120 channels.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Geophones</i> - Geophones depreciate at 1%/day. Geophones cost $100/geophone.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Cable</i> - Seismic cables depreciate at 1%/day. Cables cost $50/channel.
                                You need at least as much cable as the number of channels that you have in your
                                recording
                                system. If you
                                choose to rent more geophones and cable than channels in your recording system, you
                                can deploy all of the geophones and cables, hook up a portion of these to your recording
                                system, and then move the recording system to hook up the next portion, etc. If you
                                choose to do this, it only takes 10 additional minutes to move the spread (as opposed to
                                the
                                30 minutes
                                described below).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It takes 90 minutes to initially lay out the cable, geophones, and test the electronics,
                                and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If your spread and recording equipment requires geophones to be moved (that is, if your
                                instrument records
                                fewer channels than the ground stations you would like to occupy), it takes an
                                additional 30
                                minutes
                                every time you have to move the geophones and cables.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>

                                Sledgehammer: No additional equipment costs; it takes 5 minutes to set up at the source
                                and
                                5 minutes to acquire the data for each 10 swings of the
                                sledgehammer.

                                Shotgun: Shotgun sources depreciate at 1%/day. A shotgun source costs $5000.
                                It takes 5 minutes to set up at the source and acquire the data.
                                Each shell, consisting of a 9-gauge steel slug, costs $2.

                            <li>
                                Explosives: Explosives must be detonated in holes approximately five

                                feet deep.
                                Sources are buried to enhance source coupling, that is to get as much
                                energy from the explosive into the ground, and to prevent surface damage.
                                A depth of five feet is appropriate for charges up to 1/3 pound. You will
                                not need explosives any larger than this on this particular job.
                                Portable drilling rigs for drilling shot holes depreciate at
                                1%/day and cost $7,000.
                                Explosives cost $100 per charge. It takes 30 minutes to drill and load each shot hole.
                                Once drilled and loaded it requires 5 minutes to acquire data from the shot.
                                The drilling crew consists of two people - a field hand and a
                                licensed explosives handler. The explosives handler makes twice that of the
                                regular field hand.
                                This crew is deployed in addition to the acquisition crew described below.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can drill and load shot holes either while you are collecting the seismic
                    data, or before you collect the seismic data. Each has its advantages and
                    disadvantages.
                    If you choose to drill and load shot holes while you are acquiring the seismic
                    observations,
                    remember that the acquisition crew can not acquire seismic data
                    while the drilling crew is drilling. Thus, you must shut down the drilling crew
                    to acquire seismic data and the seismic crew to drill and load shot holes.
                    If you choose to drill and load all of the shot
                    holes prior to the acquisition of the seismic data, you must hire an additional
                    field hand to occupy the site during the off hours for security and liability
                    purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the use of explosives involves inherent risks, both personal
                    and property, beyond those normally found in more routine geophysical field work.
                    Thus, if you choose to use explosives you must carry additional
                    liability insurance. You should carry a minimum of $500,000 of additional liability
                    insurance. The cost of this is $100 per field day.

        <h3>OUTCOMES</h3>
        <p>
            The final report should be in the form of a bid. The heading
            can be in standard memo format. The bid must include survey design parameters, a summary of
            the decision-making process that led to that design (including an estimate of the likelihood that
            the survey will work), a brief discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of a controlled-
            source experiment, and a firm statement of total cost. The report must be no longer
            than two type-written pages, but details (flow-chart of the survey design process, tabulation of survey
            design parameters, breakdown of costs, etc.) can be included as appendices.
            Be sure to look at the <a href="../RFB/rfb.html" target="_blank"> Request for Bid</a>
            to ensure that you have
            included in your bid everything that the client has requested.
            Remember that the
            bid is a sales document; it should communicate quickly and effectively and should focus on those
            issues that will be of most interest to the client.
