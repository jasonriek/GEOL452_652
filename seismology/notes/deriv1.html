<H2>Derivation of Travel Time Equations: Flat Layer over Halfspace</H2>
<P>
For those who are interested, this page outlines the details of how the
equations given on the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">last page</A> were derived.
Although you don't need to memorize this derivation, a working knowledge of
its construction is useful, especially when we consider travel time curves
produced by more complex Earth models.
<P>
To derive the equations for the velocity of the halfspace and the depth to
the top of the halfspace shown previously, we first need to be able to
construct an equation that defines the time of arrival of a head wave, 
<I>tT</I>, off of a single interface at some offset, <I>x</I>. To do this
we will consider the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fraypath.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Propagation">raypath</A> of the head wave
from the source to the receiver as defined by <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsnell.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Snell's Law">Snell's
law</A>.
<P>
Consider the simple Earth model shown below. It consists of a layer with
a velocity of <I>V1</I> overlying a halfspace with a velocity of <I>V2</I>.
The depth to the top of the halfspace is <I>h</I>.

The raypath of the head wave observed at an offset <I>x</I> is shown by
the red line. This raypath consists of three segments: one traveling down
through the layer, another traveling along the layer itself, and a third
(which is identical to the first) traveling back up through the layer to
the receiver. We could, as is done in most textbooks, derive our equation
for the travel time of this wave by computing the time along each of these
segments and summing them up. In this derivation, however, we will consider
an alternate method of calculation that makes the analysis through more
complex structures much easier.
<P>
From the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">wave propagation movie</A> shown previously,
notice that the shape of the head wave as it travels back up through the
layer is that of a straight line. A graphical representation of this is
shown by the blue line in the figure above. Knowing that the head wave forms
a linear wavefront, we can consider an alternate ray path called the
<I>apparent raypath</I>. The apparent raypath is shown as the red dashed
line. Like the true raypath, it also consists of three segments. These segments,
however, are different. One travels downward vertically through the layer
from the source. The second travels along the boundary over a distance <I>x</I>.
The third travels vertically upward through the layer to the receiver. 
<P>
Let's compute the travel time of the head wave by summing up the times along
the three segments of the apparent raypath. The time along each segment
is nothing more than the length of the segment divided by the velocity
the wave travels along that segment. That is,

Consider the two segments in the layer. They are identical to each other,
so the times the wave spends traveling along each must be identical. The
head wave shown by the blue line travels along the distance <I>s1</I> over 
the same time period that it travels along the true raypath for a distance <I>d</I>.
<I>d</I> is equal to <I>s1</I> times the <I>cosine</I> of the angle <I>ic</I>,
and <I>s1</I> is simply equal to the thickness of the layer, <I>h</I>. Thus,

The travel time along the apparent raypath that lies along the layer boundary
is nothing more than the distance <I>x</I> divided by the velocity the wave
travels along the boundary, <I>V2</I>.

Thus, the total travel time of the head wave is

It is easily shown that (we'll leave this one up to you) to get the answer, you
use Snell's law to compute the sine of the angle of incidence of the incoming wave, 
<I>i1</I> (which we've called <I>ic</I> here) and then use trigometric 
relations to get an expression for the cosine of the angle.

Substituting this into our travel time expression we get the following:

This is nothing more than an equation of a straight line. The slope of the
line is given by the first term on the right-hand side and is <I>1/V2</I>.
The intercept of the line is given by the second term on the right-hand side and
is what we have called <I>t0</I>. Set the second term on the right-hand
side equal to <I>t0</I> and solve for the layer thickness, <I>h</I>. You
will get the expression given on the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">previous</A>
