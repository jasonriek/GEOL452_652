<h2>Practice Picking First Arrivals</h2>
<p>
Shown below is an example seismic record section.
Offset increases from right to left. The way in which 
the ground motion is plotted is a little different 
from what we are used to looking at. In these plots, 
we have filled in all of those portions of the trace 
that are above zero with black. Plots of this type 
are called <i>variable area</i> plots. We do this 
because it makes it much easier to correlate similar 
features in the ground motion from trace to trace.
<p>
Using the left mouse button, you may select what you
think are the times of arrivals on each trace. If you
do not like one particular selection, you may click
and drag it to a new location. If you do not like any
of your selections, you may push the <i>clear all</i>
button to erase all of your picks. After you have made
your selection, bush the <i>display my picks</i>
button to display the picks that I have made.
Note that I do not know for sure that my picks are correct.
These are just the times, given my experience picking
first arrivals, that I would choose.
