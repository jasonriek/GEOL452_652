<h2>Seismic Methods: Refraction and Reflection</h2>
<p>
Like the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=RES%2FNOTES%2Foverview.html&page=DC Resistivity%3A Notes%3A Electrical Overview">DC resistivity</a> method, seismic methods, as typically applied
in exploration seismology, are considered active geophysical methods.
In seismic surveying, ground movement caused by some source* is measured at a variety of distances from the
source.
The type of seismic experiment differs depending on what aspect of the recorded ground motion is used in the
subsequent analysis. 
We do not mean to imply by this statement that any seismic experiment can be done from a given set of observations.
On the contrary, the two types of experiments described below have very different acquisition requirements.
These acquisition differences, however, arise from the need to record specific parts of the Earth's ground motion
over specific distances.

One of the first active seismic experiments was conducted in 1845 by Robert Mallet,
considered by many to be the father of instrumental seismology.
Mallet measured the time of transmission of seismic waves, probably <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fwaves.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Elastic Waves">surface waves</a>,
generated by an explosion.
To make this measurement, Mallet placed small containers of mercury at various distances from the source of the
explosion and noted the time it took for the surface of the mercury to ripple after the explosion.
In 1909, Andrija Mohorovicic used travel-times from earthquake sources to perform a seismic refraction experiment
and discovered the existence of the crust-mantle boundary now called the <i>Moho</i>.

The earliest uses of seismic observations for the exploration of oil and mineral resources date back to the 1920s.
The seismic refraction technique, described briefly below, was used extensively in Iran to delineate structures
that contained oil.
The seismic reflection method, now the most commonly used seismic method in the oil industry, was first demonstrated
in Oklahoma in 1921. 
A plaque commemorating this event was erected on the site by the <a href="http://www.seg.org" target="_BLANK">Society of 
Exploration Geophysicists</a> in 1971.

<li><i>Refraction Seismology -</i>Refraction experiments are based on the times of arrival of the initial
ground movement generated by a source recorded at a variety of distances. 
Later arriving complications in the recorded ground motion are discarded.
Thus, the data set derived from refraction experiments consists of a series of times versus distances.
These are then interpreted in terms of the depths to subsurface interfaces and the speeds at which motion travels through
the subsurface within each layer.
These speeds are controlled by a set of physical constants, called <i>elastic  p arameters</i> that describe the material.
<p>
<li><i>Reflection Seismology -</i>
In reflection experiments, analysis is concentrated on energy arriving after the initial ground motion.
Specifically, the analysis concentrates on ground movement that has been <i>reflected</i> off of subsurface interfaces.
In this sense, reflection seismology is a very sophisticated version of the echo sounding used in submarines, ships,
and radar systems. 
In addition to examining the times of arrival of these, reflection seismic processing extracts information about the
subsurface from the amplitude and shape of the ground motion.
Subsurface structures can be complex in shape but like the refraction methods, are interpreted in terms of
boundaries separating material with differing  <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fevel.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Velocities">elastic parameters</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Each of these techniques has specific advantages and distadvantages when compared to 
 <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsadv2.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Refraction vs. Reflection">each other</a> and when 
 <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsadv.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Seismic vs. Other">compared
to other geophysical techniques</a>.
For these reasons, different industries apply these techniques to differing degrees.
For example, the oil and gas industries use the seismic reflection technique almost to the exclusion of other
geophysical techniques.
The environmental and engineering communities use seismic techniques less frequently than other geophysical techniques.
When seismic methods are used in these communities, they tend to emphasize the refraction methods over the reflection
methods.

*Any of a variety of sources can be used. Typically these sources are manmade, thus satisfying our definition
of an <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=RES%2FNOTES%2Fapintro2.html&page=DC Resistivity%3A Notes%3A Advantages and Disadvantages">active geophysical survey</a>.
One could imagine using natural sources like earthquakes. Experiments that use natural sources to
generate ground motion, however, are considered passive experiments.
