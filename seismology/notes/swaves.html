<h2>Seismic Waves</h2>
<p>
Waves that propagate through the earth as <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fwaves.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Elastic Waves">elastic waves</a> are referred to
as <i>seismic waves</i>.
There are two broad categories of seismic waves: body waves and surface waves.
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Body waves</i> - These are elastic waves that propagate through the Earth's interior. 
In reflection and refraction prospecting, body waves are the source of information used to image
the Earth's interior. 
Like the ripples on the surface of the pond example described <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fwaves.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Elastic Waves">previously</a>,
body waves propagate away from the source in all directions. 
If the speed at which body waves propagate through the Earth's interior is constant, then at any
time, these waves form a sphere around the source whose radius is dependent on the time elapsed since
the source generated the waves.
Shown below is a cross section through the earth with body waves radiated from a source (red circle)
shown at several different times.
In the figure below, <i>ms</i> stands for milli-seconds. One milli-second
equals one one-thousandth of a second (i.e., there are one thousand 
milli-seconds in a second).

The color being plotted is proportional to the amplitude of the body wave. Light blue-green is zero
amplitude, red is a large positive amplitude, and purple is a large negative amplitude.
Notice that this plot is explicitly constructed in a <a href="waves.html">reference frame</a> that
fixes time, thus allowing us to examine the spatial variations of the seismic wave.
At any given time, notice that the wave is circular with its center located at the source. This 
circle is, of course, nothing more than a two-dimensional section of the spherical shape the wave
has in three-dimensions.
<p>
Seismic body waves can be further subdivided into two classes of waves: P waves and S waves.
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>P Waves</i> - P waves are also called primary waves, because they propagate through the medium
faster than the other wave types.
In P waves, particles consistituting the medium are displaced in the same direction that the wave
propagates, in this case, the radial direction.
Thus, material is being extended and compressed as P waves propagate through the medium.
P waves are analogous to sound waves propagating through the air.
<p>
<li><i>S Waves</i> - S waves are sometimes called secondary waves, because they propagate through the
medium slower than P waves.
In S waves, particles consistituting the medium are dispaced in a direction that is perpendicular to the
direction that the wave is propagating.
In this example, as the wave propagates radially, the medium is being deformed along spherical surfaces.
</ul>
<p>
Most exploration seismic surveys use P waves as their primary source of information.
The figure shown above could, however, represent either P or S waves depending on the speed chosen to generate the plot.
<p>
<li><i>Surface Waves</i> - Surface waves are waves that propagate along the Earth's surface. Their amplitude
at the surface of the Earth can be very large, but this amplitude decays exponentially with depth.
Surface waves propagate at speeds that are slower than S waves, are less efficiently
generated by buried sources, and have amplitudes that decay with distance from the source more slowly than
is observed for body waves. 
Shown below is a cross section through a simplified Earth model (the speed of wave propagation is assumed
to be constant everywhere) showing how surface waves would appear at various times in this medium.

Like body waves, there are two classes of surface waves, <i>Love</i> and <i>Rayleigh</i> waves,
that are distinquished by the type of particle motion they impose on the medium.
For our purposes, it is not necessary to detail these differences.
Suffice it to say that for virtually all exploration surveys, surface waves are a form of noise that
we attempt to suppress.
For reflection surveys in particular, suppression of surface wave energy becomes particularly important,
because the amplitudes of surface waves generated from shallowly buried sources are often observed to
be larger than the amplitudes of the body waves you are attempting to record and interpret.   
For refraction surveys, surface waves are less of a problem because we are only interested in the time
of arrival of the first wave.
Surface waves are never the first arrival. 
In all of the remaining discussion about seismic waves, we will consider only body waves.
