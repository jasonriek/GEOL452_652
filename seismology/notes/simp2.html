<h2>Travel Times: High Velocity Layer Over Low Velocity Halfspace</h2>
<p>
Now, the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fbound.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves and Boundaries">first model</a> we considered consisted of a
high velocity layer over a lower velocity half-space, as shown below.

For this model, what first arrivals would you expect to see, and what can you
determine about the subsurface structure from these arrivals?
A snapshot of the waves produced from a surface source as they interact with
the boundary is shown below. This is the same image that was shown
<a href="bound.html">previously</a>.

As was described earlier, we need to consider three wave types. The direct 
arrival, the reflected arrival, and the transmitted (or refracted) arrival.
Notice that the difference between the waves produced in this model and 
those produced when a low velocity layer overlies a higher velocity 
halfspace is the absence of a head wave.
<p>
Let's consider the transmitted (refracted) arrival first. 
The refracted arrival propagates downward from the boundary. If there is no
other structure below our first layer, this wave will continue to move
downward. As such, it can never be observed by receivers located on the Earth's
surface. 
<p>
The reflected arrival can be observed on the Earth's surface, but it must 
always arrive after the direct arrival. Thus, as before, the reflected 
arrival is <i>never</i> a first arrival, and we therefore do not use it
in refraction surveying.
The only arrival we'll observe as a first arrival is, therefore, the direct
arrival. In this model, the direct arrival propagates away from the source
at constant speed (5000 m/s). So, if we were to plot the time of arrival
of the first arrivals versus distance from the source, we would get a figure
like the one shown below.

What can we learn from this plot? Well, not too much. From the plot we
could compute the speed at which seismic energy travels in the layer, just
as we did <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">previously</a>. But notice that our first
arrival information no longer tells us anything about the speed at which
seismic waves travel in the halfspace. In fact, they no longer indicate
any existence of the halfspace!! By this, I mean the travel times shown
above would be identical for a uniform Earth that had a wave
propagation speed of 5000 m/s. 
<p>
This example illustrates one of the fundamental limitations of using the
seismic refraction method. To be successfully employed (i.e., to get the
correct answers from the recorded data), seismic wave speed <i>MUST</i>
increase with depth. If wave speed decreases with depth, you will not be
able to detect this wave speed decrease. And you will, as a consequence,
almost assuredly interpret the first arrivals incorrectly which would result in
an estimate of the subsurface structure that is wrong.
