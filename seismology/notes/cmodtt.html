<H2>Travel Time Curves From Multiple Subsurface Layers</H2>
<P>
The travel time curve for the first arrivals that we would observe from 
the model given on the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmod.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves in Multiple Layers">previous page</A> is shown below.
The green line segment represents travel times associated with the direct
arrival, the red line are times associated with the head wave off of the
top interface, and the purple line represents times for the head wave off
of the bottom interface. Notice that in this example, although our bottom
interface is only 175 meters deep, we do not see arrivals from this interface
as first arrivals until we reach offsets in excess of 900 meters!!
A general rule of thumb is that you need offsets of 3 to 5 times the
depth down to which you would like to see.

As you would expect, we can determine the speeds of seismic wave propagation
in the two layers and the halfspace from the slopes of the travel time
curves. This is the identical procedure that we used in interpreting the 
more simple curves that arose from the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">simple layer over
a halfspace model</A>. The depths to each interface, again like the simple
model we have described previously, can be computed from the intercept times,
<I>t01</I> and <I>t02</I>, and the velocities. Although we will not derive
them, the equations for computing the depths are given below. <I>D1</I> is
the depth to the first interface and <I>D2</I> is the depth to the second
interface.

Additional layers simply add additional linear segments to the observed
travel time curve. From these segments and their respective zero offset times,
we can compute the velocities within each layer and the depths to each
interface...usually!!
