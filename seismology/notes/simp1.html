<h2>Another Simple Earth Model: Low-Velocity Layer Over a Halfspace</h2>
<p>
Thus far we have considered body wave propagation through 
<a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fswaves.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Wave Types">constant velocity media</a> and in media
consisting of a <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fbound.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves and Boundaries">high-velocity layer overlying a lower velocity halfspace</a>.
As observed on the surface of the Earth, a constant velocity media only generates direct waves while
the layered model generates direct and reflected waves.
What happens if the media consists of a low-velocity layer overlying a high-velocity halfspace?
Consider the Earth model shown below.

Shown below are a few snapshots of the seismic waves as they propagate away from the source
at times of 65, 80, and 110 ms**.

For these times, the wavefield qualitatively looks like that observed for our previous layered model
consisting of a high-velocity layer overlying a low-velocity halfspace.
This is true with exception to the relative curvature and the wavelength differences of the refracted
wavefield compared to the direct and the reflected wavefield. 
In this particular case, the refracted wavefield is more curved than the direct wavefield as a consequence
of the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fraypath.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Propagation">raypaths</a> bending at the boundary in accordance with 
<a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsnell.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Snell's Law">Snell's Law</a>.
Because the velocities increase across the boundary with depth, the refracted wavefield now has a longer
wavelength than the direct or the reflected wavefield.
The opposite sense of the velocity constrast across the boundary produced the opposite relationship
in wavelengths in our <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fbound.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves and Boundaries">previous</a> layered structure.
<p>
From 0 to about 70 ms, the wave propagates solely within the upper layer. 
After 70 ms, the wave begins to interact with the boundary at 100 meters depth.
As before, upon interaction with the boundary, part of the wave is transmitted through the boundary,
the refracted wave, and part bounces off of the boundary, the reflected wave.
<p>
If we allow the waves to propagate further, an interesting phenomenon begins to occur with relation to the
refracted arrival.
Consider the snapshot shown below.

<p>
As the refracted arrival propagates through the halfspace, because it travels faster than the direct arrival
in the layer, it begins to move across the layer boundary before the direct arrival.
The refracted arrival is propagating horizontally at the velocity of the halfspace, and the direct and the
reflected arrivals propagate horizontally at the speed of the layer.
<p> 
As the refracted wave moves across the layer boundary, it generates a new wave type in the layer called a <i>critically
refracted</i> or <i>head wave</i> that propagates upward to the surface.
The <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2FHmovie.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model 1%3A Movie">movie version</a> of the above snapshots show this phenomenon the best.
In the previously considered layered model, a high-velocity layer overlying a low-velocity halfspace, this
arrival <i>never</i> exists. This is primarily because the refracted arrival, the direct arrival, and the reflected
arrival all move across the boundary at the same rate (There is never a separation in the arrivals at the
boundary that we see above).
<p>
In this particular example, note that if you were observing the ground's motion from any point on the
Earth's surface, you could observe <i>three</i> distinct waves.
The reflected arrival will always be observed after the direct arrival at any distance from the source, thus
it can never be the first arriving energy.
At short distances between the source and the receiver, the direct arrival
would be observed first.
At long distances, however, notice that the critically refracted arrival could be observed <i>before</i> the
direct arrival.
<p>
These observations, if the velocity of the material increases with depth, the seismic waves recorded initially
at a given receiver will be of the direct wave at short source/receiver distances and the head wave at
long source/receiver distances, form the basis of the <i>seismic refraction method</i>.
