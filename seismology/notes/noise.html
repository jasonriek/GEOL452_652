<H2>Sources of Noise</H2>
<P>
As with all geophysical methods, a variety of noises can contaminate our
seismic observations. Because we control the source of the seismic energy, we
can control some types of noise. For example, if the noise is random in 
occurrence, such as some of the types of noise described below, we may be able
to minimize its affect on our seismic observations by recording repeated
sources all at the same location and averaging the result. We've already
seen the power of averaging in reducing noise in the other geophysical
techniques we have looked at. Beware, however, that averaging only works if
the noise is random. If it is systematic in some fashion, no amount of averaging
will remove it.
<P>
The noises that plague seismic observations can be lumped into three catagories
depending on their source.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Uncontrolled Ground Motion </I> - This is the most obvious type of 
noise. Anything that causes the ground to move, other than your source,
will generate noise. As you would expect, there could be a wide variety of
sources for this type of noise. These would include traffic traveling down
a road, running engines and equipment, and people walking. Other sources
that you might not consider include wind, aircraft, and thunder. Wind produces
noise in a couple of ways but of concern here is its affect on vegetation.
If you are surveying near trees, wind causes the branches of the trees to move, and
this movement is transmitted through the trees and into the ground via the
trees' roots. Aircraft and thunder produce noise by the coupling of ground
motion to the sound that we hear produced by each.
<P>
<LI><I>Electronic Noise</I> - As you've already <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fgeophone.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Geophones">
seen</A>, geophones convert the ground motion they detect to electrical
signals. These signals are then transmitted down the cable, amplified by
the recording system, and recorded. Thus, anything that can cause changes
in the electrical signal in the cable or the recording system causes noise
in our recorded data. Electrical noise can come from a variety of sources.
For example, dirty or loose connections between the geophones and the cable
or the cable and the recording system can produce noise. Wet connections
anywhere in the system can cause electrical noise. Wind can also cause
electrical noise. This occurs if, for example, the cable is suspended in
bushes. As the wind blows the bushes, this moves the cable. The cable is
nothing more than a long electrical conductor. As it moves in the Earth's
magnetic field, an electrical current is produced in the cable. 
<P>
<LI><I>Geologic Noise</I> - Finally, we can consider any type of subsurface
geologic structure that we can not easily interpret to be a source of noise.
In seismic refraction surveying, we will assume that the subsurface structure
varies laterally only along the line connecting the source to the geophones.
If the Earth actually varies significantly away from our line, it is possible
for us to misinterpret the seismic waves we record as structure below
the geophones instead of structure to the side of the geophones. 
Like our <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=RES%2FNOTES%2F1layer1.html&page=DC Resistivity%3A Notes%3A Single Layer Curves">resistivity</A> observations,
we will interpret our seismic observations as if they had been generated from
relatively simple earth models.
Although these models can be more complex than those used to interpret
resistivity observations (we can have dipping layers and topography on the
layers), in interpreting refraction seismic observations we must assume that
variations occur along the line in which data is collected only.
