<H2>Hidden Layers</H2>
<P>
Can layers exist in the subsurface that are not observable from first
arrival times? As you may have guessed from the wording used on the previous
page, the answer is yes!! Layers that can not be distinguished from 
first arrival time information are known as <I>hidden layers</I>.
There are two possible senerios that produce hidden layers.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Low Velocity Layers</I> - This is the most obvious cause of hidden
layers. Consider the model shown below.

Because the velocity decreases downward across the first interface, no head
wave is generated at this boundary (as was the case for the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fbound.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves and Boundaries">
first</A> model we considered).
At the second interface, however, a head wave is generated that can be observed
at sufficiently large offsets. Thus, our first arrival time observations
will consist of direct arrivals at small offsets and head wave arrivals
from the deeper interface at larger offsets. The first arrival travel-time
curve generated from this model is shown below.

Notice that this travel-time curve is indistinguishable from the curves
produced by a <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fttsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Travel Time Curves">model</A> containing a single interface.
Hence, from this data alone you would be unable to detect the presence of
the middle layer. Using the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">methodology</A> described
earlier, you would interpret the subsurface as consisting of a single layer
with a velocity of 1500 m/s (from the slope of the travel-time curve for
the direct arrival) underlain by a halfspace with a velocity of
5000 m/s (from the slope of the head wave travel-time curve). Using the
value of <I>t01</I> from the graph and the values of the velocities, 
you would guess that the thickness of the layer is 314 m!! You would be wrong.
<P>
<LI><I>Thin, Large Velocity Constrast Layers</I> - Another type of hidden
layer is produced by media whose velocity greatly increases with a small change in depth.
Consider the model shown below.
<P>

<P>
Notice that in this model there is a thin layer that is underlain by the
halfspace, and the halfspace has a velocity much larger than the upper layer.
<P>
Unlike the previous example, head waves are produced at both interfaces just
as described <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmod.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves in Multiple Layers">previously</A>. Because the layer is
thin and the velocity of the underlying medium is larger, however, the
head wave coming from the top boundary is <I>never</I> observed as a first
arrival!! It is overtaken by the rapidly traveling head wave coming from the
bottom boundary before it can overtake the direct arrival. The travel-time
curve you would observe is shown below.
<P>

<P>
The red line in the figure shows the travel times for the head wave coming
off of the top boundary. As described above, it is never observed as a first
arrival. Therefore, like before, you would interpret the first arrivals as
being generated from a subsurface structure that consists of a single layer
over a halfspace. Again, like before, you can correctly estimate the velocities
in the top layer and the halfspace, but because you missed the middle layer,
the depth you would compute from <I>t01</I> to the top of the halfspace would
be incorrect.
</UL>
<P>
In both of these cases, notice that the existence of the hidden layer can not
be determined from the travel-time observations you are collecting. So, in
practice you probably will never know that hidden layers existed under your
survey. That is, until the client begins to excavate or drill!!
