<h2>Estimating Dips and Depths From Refraction Observations</h2>
<p>
    Although we could derive exact expressions from which to compute the depths
    and dips of multiple dipping layers from first arrival observations, for our
    purposes, all we really need to be able to do is to estimate these parameters
    from the field records. The procedure for estimating these parameters
    described on this page is only valid if the layers do not have excessive
    dips.
<p>
    Like the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">multiple horizontal layer case</a>, multiple
    dipping layers will also produce head waves that can be observed on the
    surface of the Earth from which subsurface Earth structure can be determined.
    The same <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fhidden.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Hidden Layers">caveats</a> hold in this case concerning those
    structures that can not be resolved from first arrival observations.

<p>
    So, in general, Earth structures like the one shown above produce travel-time
    curves like those shown below that can be used to estimate the depths and
    dips of each layer. <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fgfield.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Field Procedure">Again</a>, to identify the presence
    of dipping layers, you must acquire the data by shooting in two directions.
    Notice that in this example, the dip effect on the observed travel-times
    is quite subtle. Each layer in this model dips at a half degree.

    If the dips are small, then we can estimate the structure under each source
    by assuming the dips are zero and by using the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">
    expressions</a> we have already derived. After doing this for each source,
    we can then estimate the dip of each layer. The general flow for such a
    procedure would include the following:
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the slope of each line segment in the observed travel-time
            curves for both source locations,
<p>
    <li>The slopes of the nearest offset portions of the two travel-time curves
        should be equal to each other with a value of <i>1/V1</i>,
<p>
    <li>For the travel-time segments representing the refracted arrival, average
        the slopes of the refracted arrival traveling up dip with that of the arrival
        traveling down dip on each refractor. This requires that you identify on
        the travel-time curves those portions of the curve originating from the
        same boundary. In this case, you would average the slopes of the two red line
        segments (<i>1/V2a</i> and <i>1/V2b</i>) and the slopes
        of the two purple line segments (<i>1/V3a</i> and <i>1/V3b</i>).
        Use the <i>absolute
            value</i> of the slope in this calcuation,
<p>
    <li>Compute your estimate for <i>V2</i> and <i>V3</i> by taking the
        reciprocal of the averages generated in the preceding step,
<p>
    <li>Using these velocities, the zero intercept times at each source
        (<i>t01a</i> and <i>t02a</i> for the source to the left and <i>t01b</i> and
        <i>t02b</i> for the source to the right) and
        the <a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">equations</a> given previously estimate the
        depth to each layer underneath each source, and
<p>
    <li>From these depths and knowing the separation between the two sources,
        estimate the dip on each layer.
        </ul>
<p>
    Remember this procedure will give you estimates of the depth to each layer
    and the dip on the layer. The modeling codes used in the exercise will
    provide more rigorous estimates that do not depend on the small dip assumption
    made here.
