<h2>Snell's Law</h2>
<p>
If we include raypaths for the reflected, refracted, and direct arrivals described on the
<a target="_BLANK" href="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fbound.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Waves and Boundaries">previous page</a>, we would find that a selected set of the raypaths would
look like those shown below.

These raypaths are simply drawn to be perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wavefield
at all times.
As they interact with the boundary, these raypaths obey Snell's Law.
Snell's Law can be derived any number of different ways, but the way it is
usually described is that the raypath that follows Snell's Law is the path
by which the wave would take the least amount of time to propagate
between two fixed points.

Consider the refracted raypaths shown above. In our particular case, <i>v2</i>, the
velocity of the halfspace, is less than <i>v1</i>, the velocity of the layer.
Snell's Law states that in this case, <i>i2</i>, the angle between a perpendicular
to the boundary and the direction of the refracted raypath, should be smaller than
<i>i1</i>, the angle between a perpendicular to the boundary and the direction of the
direct raypath.
This is exactly the situation predicted by the wavefronts shown in the figure above.
<p>
If <i>v2</i> had been larger than <i>v1</i>, a situation we will consider in some detail
later, then Snell's Law predicts that <i>i2</i> would be greater than <i>i1</i>.
In this case, the wavefront of the refracted wavefield would have smaller curvature than
the wavefront of the direct field (in the present case, the wavefront of the refracted
field has greater curvature than the wavefront of the direct field).
<p>
Snell's law can also be applied to the reflected raypath by setting <i>v2</i> equal
to <i>v1</i>.
If <i>v2</i> is equal to <i>v1</i>, then the angle of reflection, <i>i2</i>, should
be equal to the angle of the incident wave, <i>i1</i>, as we would expect from our
physics classes.
Again, this is exactly the situation predicted by the wavefronts of the reflected wavefield
shown above.
<p>
As one final note for the case under consideration, for a high velocity layer overlying a low
velocity halfspace, the waves described <a href="bound.html">previously</a> and shown above (i.e., direct,
reflected, and refracted) are the <i>only</i> body waves observed.
Notice also that if we were to place receivers at the Earth's surface, we would <i>never</i>
observe the refracted arrival.
It continues to propagate downward, never returning to the surface.
