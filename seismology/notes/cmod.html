<H2>Wave Propagation with Multiple Subsurface Layers</H2>
<P>
We have <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">already</A> considered seismic wave propagation
through a simple model of the Earth consisting of a low velocity layer overlying
a higher velocity halfspace.
At some surface locations, we can observe three separate seismic arrivals in
this model: the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">direct</A>, 
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">
reflected</A>, and 
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">critically refracted (head wave)</A>
arrivals. Only the direct arrival and the head wave are observed as first
arrivals.
We can <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fssimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Structure from Times">determine</A> the speed at which seismic waves
propagate through the layer and the halfspace and the thickness of the 
layer from observations of first arrival times at various source/receiver
distances (offsets).
<P>
Now, what if the Earth is more complex? Consider the slightly more complicated
model shown below.
<P>

<P>
This model consists of two layers overlying a halfspace. The speed of wave
propagation of the halfspace is greater than either layer, and the speed
of propagation in the middle halfspace is greater than the speed in the
top halfspace (i.e, velocity increases with depth). For this model, will
observations of first arrival times provide us with enough information to
estimate all of the relevant model parameters? The answer is yes!
<P>
Three snapshots of the wavefield at various times after initiation of the
source are shown below. In addition, clicking on the link given below the
snapshots will initiate a wave propagation animation.

Examine the 198 ms snapshot. Several seismic waves are apparent. First notice
that like the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fsimp1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Simple Model I">one layer model</A>, there are direct,
reflected, and critically refracted (head wave - B1) arrivals originating from the
top interface. The head wave generated off of this top interface propagates
horizontally with a speed equal to that of the middle layer.
<P>
Now, because there is a second interface below this, we 
generate additional arrivals that can be observed at the Earth's surface.
There exists a second reflected arrival and critically refracted (head wave -
B2) arrival originating from the bottom interface. The reflected arrival is too
small in amplitude to be observed in the snapshot. The second head wave
is just beginning to develop at a distance of about 450 m. Like the
head wave off of the top interface, this head wave will propagate horizontally
with a speed equal to that of the halfspace.
<P>
Thus, at any distance we could observe one of three separate first arrivals.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>At short offsets, we will observe the direct arrival. This arrival 
propagates horizontally along the Earth's surface at a speed equal to that
of the top layer.
<P>
<LI>At intermediate offsets, we will observe the head wave off of the
top interface (B1) as a first arrival. This arrival propagates horizontally
along the Earth's surface at a speed equal to that of the middle layer.
<P>
<LI>At large offsets, we will observe the head wave off of the top of the
half space (B2) as the first arrival. This arrival propagates horizontally
along the Earth's surface at a speed equal to that of the halfspace.
</UL>
<P>
Although this model contains only two layers, if it contained more layers
we could, in general, detect the presence of these layers from first arrival
times only. It is important to note, however, that there will 
be <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fhidden.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Hidden Layers">specific instances</A>
where this isn't true.
