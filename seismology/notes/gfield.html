<H2>Recognizing Dipping Layers: A Field Procedure</H2>
<P>
On the previous two pages we've seen that the travel-time curves collected
over dipping layers have the same shape as those collected over horizontal
layers. Given this, is it possible to tell from the travel-time observations
alone whether the layers are dipping or not?
<P>
Well, to make a long story short, the answer is yes. Although the form of
the curves is the same, notice that the slope of the travel-time curve 
defined by the refracted arrival and the intercept time of the refracted arrival
differs depending on whether you are shooting up dip or down dip.
<P>
Imagine we were to acquire refraction seismic observations over a flat, horizontal
boundary as shown in the figure below.

We set out a line of geophones spaced at some interval from right to left
as shown by the black arrows. We then placed our source to the left of the
line of geophones and acquired travel-time observations. Next, we moved our
source an equal distance to the right of the line of geophones and 
re-acquired the observations. In comparing the two sets of data, what would
you expect them to look like?
<P>
In this case, since the layer is horizontal and the distances between the
two sources are the same, just reversed, I would expect the travel times
acquired from each source to be identical when plotted versus source/receiver
offset but reversed when plotted versus receiver location. A plot of the
latter is shown below.

In this particular example, the first source was at a position of 0 meters, and the
second source was at a position of 150 meters. Because the geometry of the
layer is the same under all of the sources and all of the receivers, no
matter what positions the sources and receivers are in, as long as the
offsets are constant, the travel-time curves have the exact same shape.
<P>
Now imagine doing the same experiment over a dipping layer as shown below.

The travel-time curves derived in this case are shown below.
Recall that when <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fdip1.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Dipping Layers I">shooting down dip</A>, the travel-time
curve defining the head wave off of the boundary has a slope greater than
<I>1/V2</I> and a zero offset time from which you would compute a depth
to the boundary greater than the depth to the boundary underneath the source.
When <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fdip2.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Dipping Layers II">shooting up dip</A>, the travel-time curve defining
the head wave off of the boundary has a slope of less than <I>1/V2</I>
and a zero offset time from which you would compute a depth to the boundary
less than the depth of the boundary underneath the source.

Thus, by acquiring refraction seismic observations in two directions, we can
immediately determine whether or not subsurface layers are dipping. If dipping
layers are present, the travel-time curves obtained in the two directions
are no longer mirror images of each other.
