<H2>Estimating Dips and Depths From Refraction Observations</H2>
<P>
Although we could derive exact expressions from which to compute the depths
and dips of multiple dipping layers from first arrival observations, for our
purposes, all we really need to be able to do is to estimate these parameters
from the field records. The procedure for estimating these parameters 
described on this page is only valid if the layers do not have excessive
dips.
<P>
Like the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">multiple horizontal layer case</A>, multiple
dipping layers will also produce head waves that can be observed on the
surface of the Earth from which subsurface Earth structure can be determined.
The same <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fhidden.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Hidden Layers">caveats</A> hold in this case concerning those
structures that can not be resolved from first arrival observations.

So, in general, Earth structures like the one shown above produce travel-time
curves like those shown below that can be used to estimate the depths and
dips of each layer. <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fgfield.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Field Procedure">Again</A>, to identify the presence
of dipping layers, you must acquire the data by shooting in two directions.
Notice that in this example, the dip effect on the observed travel-times
is quite subtle. Each layer in this model dips at a half degree.

If the dips are small, then we can estimate the structure under each source
by assuming the dips are zero and by using the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">
expressions</A> we have already derived. After doing this for each source,
we can then estimate the dip of each layer. The general flow for such a
procedure would include the following: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Determine the slope of each line segment in the observed travel-time
curves for both source locations,
<P>
<LI>The slopes of the nearest offset portions of the two travel-time curves
should be equal to each other with a value of <I>1/V1</I>,
<P>
<LI>For the travel-time segments representing the refracted arrival, average
the slopes of the refracted arrival traveling up dip with that of the arrival
traveling down dip on each refractor. This requires that you identify on
the travel-time curves those portions of the curve originating from the
same boundary. In this case, you would average the slopes of the two red line
segments (<I>1/V2a</I> and <I>1/V2b</I>) and the slopes 
of the two purple line segments (<I>1/V3a</I> and <I>1/V3b</I>). 
Use the <I>absolute
value</I> of the slope in this calcuation,
<P>
<LI>Compute your estimate for <I>V2</I> and <I>V3</I> by taking the
reciprocal of the averages generated in the preceding step,
<P>
<LI>Using these velocities, the zero intercept times at each source
(<I>t01a</I> and <I>t02a</I> for the source to the left and <I>t01b</I> and
<I>t02b</I> for the source to the right) and
the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fcmodtt.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Times from Multiple Layers">equations</A> given previously estimate the
depth to each layer underneath each source, and
<P>
<LI>From these depths and knowing the separation between the two sources,
estimate the dip on each layer.
</UL>
<P>
Remember this procedure will give you estimates of the depth to each layer
and the dip on the layer. The modeling codes used in the exercise will
provide more rigorous estimates that do not depend on the small dip assumption
made here.
