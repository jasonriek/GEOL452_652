<H2>Interpretation: Reading First Arrivals</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="SEIS/NOTES/sastrace.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
As we have <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Fseismogram.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A Ground Motion">already</A> described, we obtain records
of ground motion detected at each geophone over some time interval. The
relevant piece of information that we would like to extract from these records
is the time of arrival for the <A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Ffarr.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A First Arrivals">first arriving</A> seismic energy.
<P>
One such record is shown to the right. 
A discussion on how first arrivals can be chosen has 
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="notes_template.jsp?url=SEIS%2FNOTES%2Ffarr.html&page=Refraction%3A Notes%3A First Arrivals">already</A> been given. 
Suffice it to say that on this record it is fairly easy to see that the
first arriving seismic energy comes in at the time corresponding to the
blue line. The record shown, however, is noise free. With the inclusion
of noise, the choice of time of the first arrival becomes much more complicated
and, in truth, should be considered part of the interprational process.
<P>
With noisy data, it is often easier to choose first arrivals by comparing
ground motion recorded at a variety of offsets. In the example shown below,
for instance, it is much easier to distinguish the small refracted arrivals
on the far offset traces when a group of these traces are plotted together
in a record section.

The best way to begin to understand how to pick the first arrivals is to
actually try picking a few. Record sections from two data sets are pointed
to below. Click on each button and try your hand at picking first arrivals.
