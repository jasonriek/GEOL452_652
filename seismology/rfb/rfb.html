            <h2>Bidding Scenario</h2>

        <p>
            You have been able to define the gross nature of the water table
            interface below the survey area.
            Like gravity or magnetic
            measures, resistivity measurements represent the integrated effect of all
            structures surrounding the electrodes. Unlike gravity and magnetics, however, the placement
            of sources (current electrodes) and receivers (potential electrodes) at differing
            locations to control the depth of penetration also has the effect of potentially misrepresenting
            horizontal variations in apparent resistivity as depth variations. Because of this, lateral
            variations in resistivity are difficult to detect using the sounding methods described
            previously. Other methods, namely profile methods, have been developed for such problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the potential complications produced by lateral variations in resistivity,
            the nature of the saturated sediment/bedrock interface should have been poorly defined by
            your resistivity survey.
            This is because your saturated sediment layer, with its low resistivities, acts as a channel
            to electrical current flow.
            Thus, very little current actually flows below this channel into the more resistive bedrock.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../information/survedet.gif" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            These things being said, the client is rather excited about the findings of the resistivity
            survey, particularly from the standpoint that the groundwater trapped behind the dike
            could potentially be used as a water source for the development.
            Unfortunately, the developers of this site do not own the water rights to the Clear Creek
            watershed. These water rights extend from Clear Creek itself to all of its tributaries
            both above and underground.
            Clear Creek is shown on the map to the right flowing from west to east about a
            half mile south of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client would therefore like to answer two questions concerning the groundwater
            underlying the site: 1) is there an exploitable underground reservoir beneath the
            site, and 2) is this reservoir part of the Clear Creek watershed?
            In her discussions with the owners of the Clear Creek watershed (the City of Golden),
            they have made it clear that if the answer to the second question is no, they
            will question this conclusion by legal means before relinquishing their rights to
            the groundwater.
            Thus, any conclusions you might make regarding the nature of the groundwater must
            be defendable in a court of law.
        </p>

        <p>
            In an effort to further define the geometry of water table and the nature of the sediment/
            bedrock interface, bids are being sought to collect and interpret <i>P-wave</i> seismic
            refraction observations.
            You are free to specify the number of refraction profiles to be collected and their
            locations and orientations within the survey area.
            Like the DC resistivity surveys, your surveys must be confined to the client's property.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Your submitted bid should contain the following:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="square">
