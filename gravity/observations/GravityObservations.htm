                <h2>Introduction and Statement of Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    In designing a gravity survey for a particular application, there are several design
                    parameters that must be chosen or known: gravity station spacing, location of the
                    base station, time interval between base station reoccupations, and the level of
                    reading error inherent to the basic observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exercise focuses on assessing the latter two parameters: base station reoccupation
                    interval and the level of reading error inherent to the observations.
                </p>
                <ul class="square">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        <b>Reoccupation Interval</b> - The time interval between subsequent gravity readings
                        at the base station is an important parameter in controlling the effectiveness of the
                        <a href="../notes/GravityNotes13InstrumentDrift.htm">drift</a> and
                        <a href="../notes/GravityNotes14EarthTides.htm">tidal</a>
                        corrections computed from the field observations.
                        There is an inherent trade-off between survey cost and survey accuracy in choosing this parameter.
                        <ul class="circle">
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;;"><b>Short Time Intervals</b> - The use of a short time interval between subsequent
                                <a href="../notes/GravityNotes16TemporalVariationFieldProcedure.htm">base station</a>
                                readings will produce better estimates of the tidal and drift components of the observed
                                field so
                                that they can be more accurately removed.
                                More frequent base station readings, however, allow for fewer gravity stations to be
                                surveyed during
                                a given time period. Thus, the smaller the base station reoccupation interval, the longer it
                                takes
                                to complete a given survey, and the more the survey costs.
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Long Time Intervals</b> - By reoccupying the base station less frequently, more gravity
                                stations can be surveyed during a given time period. Hence, the cost of the survey can be
                                reduced.
                                If the time interval between subsequent
                                <a href="../notes/GravityNotes15TemporalVariationCorrectionStrategy.htm">
                                    base station readings is too long</a>, however, the drift and
                                the tidal component of the observed field can not be correctly removed from the data set.
                                Thus,
                                residual* drift and tides will corrupt the final data.
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            To estimate what the optimum time interval between subsequent base station reoccupations given the
                            cost/accuracy tradeoff, we will use the earth tide data
                            that was presented in the notes and is reproduced to the right. Given that this data set was
                            acquired
                            at a single location, it directly shows the gravitational variation resulting from tides and
                            instrument drift without geologic complications. Thus, we can use this data set to estimate the
                            optimal base station reoccupation interval. In this case, as is the case with choosing parameters
                            for all
                            geophysical surveys, optimal depends on the specifics of the target that is being sought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        <b>Observation Resolution</b> - All measures involve an inherent error. That is, no
                        measure can be made with absolute accuracy.
                        This is indeed true with measurements of the Earth's gravitational acceleration.
                        These errors could be due to inaccurate leveling of the instrument, motion of the instrument
                        caused by traffic, microseisms, or people walking about, or errors in reading the output of the
                        instrument.
                        In the tidal data set shown above, for example, the author** reported a reading error of 0.01 to 0.02
                        mgal.
                        This level of reading error is quite good, being near the resolution possible with the instrumentation.
                        Exploration gravity surveys usually have reading errors larger than this. The exception,
                        surveys that are designed to minimize this error, are referred to as <i>micro-gravity
                        surveys</i>.
                        <p>
                            One common method of reducing these errors is to make multiple readings at a single location
                            and averaging the result. If the errors associated with the readings are random, it can be shown
                            that
                            the reading error is reduced by the square root of the number of observations made.
                        </p>
                        <br/>

                        <img src="../notes/grav_images/grerror.gif" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left">

                        <p>
                            Thus, if the error associated with one reading is 0.02 mgals, averaging 4 readings will
                            reduce the error to 0.01 mgals, averaging 16 readings will reduce the error to 0.005 mgals, etc.
                            Notice, that because this technique requires multiple observations at each station, relying
                            on reading averaging to reduce reading errors will increase the cost of the survey.

                            Shown to the left is a series of gravity observations made at a single location by a novice
                            gravity crew. We will use these observations to make conservative estimates of the errors inherent in our gravity
                            observations. If there were no reading errors in this data set, we would expect all of the observations to lie
                            approximately along a straight line. The slope of this line depends on where in the tidal cycle
                            these observations were collected (Remember all of the observations will not have the same value
                            because they will still contain an earth tide contribution).

                                        worry about the last set of observations between 45.33 and 47.33 hours). These values now
                                        represent

                                        Test how good your predictions are by subtracting the values given in column 3 from the
                                        observed

                                        values given in column 2. The result of this operation has to yield a zero every 5 hours. If
                                        it doesn't,
                                        you
                                        either did the linear interpolation or the subtraction wrong. At the intermediate times,
                                        these values
                                        represent
                                        the residual tidal affect that your interpolation did not correctly account for. If our

                                        is good, these residuals should all be small.

                                        To compute the RMS of the residules, do the following: sum the squares of the residuals,
                                        divide by the
                                        number of residuals used

                                        residual),
                                        and

                                        Repeat these steps for base station reoccupation intervals of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.66 hours.
                                        For these shorter time intervals, it is not necessary to complete these tasks over the
                                        entire data set.
                                        The
                                        time length you choose, however, should be at least three reoccupation intervals long or 12
                                        hours,
                                        whichever

                                Plot the RMS of the residuals versus base station reoccupation interval. This value
                                should decrease with decreasing reoccupation interval.
                            </li>

                                Discuss the results. Assume base station observations require 10 minutes to complete and regular
                                gravity
                                stations require 5 minutes to complete.
                                Thus, if you were to require a base station reoccupation interval of 2 hours, in 2 hours you could
                                collect
                                22 gravity stations in addition to the base station observations. If you were to require a base
                                station
                                reoccupation interval of 1 hour, in 2 hours you could collect 20 gravity stations in addition to the
                                base
                                station observations. If you were to require a base station reoccupation interval of every 40
                                minutes,
                                in
                                2 hours you could collect 18 gravity stations.
                                What would be your recommendation for the base station reoccupation
                                interval that minimizes the potential of incorrectly accounting for tidal and drift variations while
                                maximizing
                                the cost effectiveness of the survey?
