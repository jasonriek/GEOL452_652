        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
            Geologists and engineers often perceive the interpretation of geophysical data as "geomagic" because of
            the mathematical complexity of the underlying theory. This need not be the case if all of the partners in a
            project (geologists, engineers, and geophysicists) concentrate on the exploration process. The last exercise
            introduced you to the application of formal engineering design techniques to the planning of a
            geophysical survey. In this exercise, we will study how the same kind of
            structured decision-making processes
            can be applied to the interpretation of geophysical data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps the most common failing of data interpreters is to become committed to their first interpretation
            too quickly. Once they have settled on their first interpretation, they tend to try to force all of the data
            to
            fit that interpretation. Unfortunately, because of the inherent uncertainty in geophysical data, it often is
            possible to force a set of data to fit a number of different models. Even though the data fits their first
            interpretation, there is no guarantee that it is the most likely interpretation. Using a well-defined,
            structured
            approach to the interpretive process can minimize the chance of delivering the wrong interpretation -- or
            can at least demonstrate that the preferred interpretation is suspect. This sort of "honesty" is what leads
            to
            trust between client and contractor, and both gain in the end.
        </p>
        <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <hr />
                <b>There are four learning objectives:</b>
        <ul class="square">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Gain experience with both data presentation and modeling,</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Develop an understanding for the kinds of corrections applied to gravity
                data, with special
            </li>
            emphasis on the empirical corrections that require interpolation between reference points,
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Codify the steps involved in processing and interpreting geophysical data,
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Get exposure to the problem of matching gravity anomalies with possible
                geologic sources.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you have not already done so, you first need to
            <a href="../acquisition/GravityDataAcquisition.htm" target="_blank">generate a gravity data set using your
                survey parameters</a>
            and download them to your computer.
            As you can see from the plot of the observations, they look much more complex than would be expected from
            the anomaly produced by a simple tunnel.
            The objective in this exercise is to attempt to enhance the gravity
            anomaly due to the target and interpret that anomaly in terms of the location, shape, and condition of the
            target. There are two milestones in the process of accomplishing this objective:

        <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">PROCEDURE</h2>
        <hr />
            For this exercise, you will need the gravity observations generated from your survey, a spreadsheet, and one
            of the symbolic math packages pointed to below. Once you have these, you can begin on the following
            procedure:
            <br /><br />
        <ul class="square">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px"><b>Process the data to remove or minimize all variations not deriving from the target:</b>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Load the generated gravity observations into your spreadsheet and
                        generate a plot of gravity versus
                        position along the line. Notice that the data file that you have generated contains three
                        columns of data.
                        The first gives the location of the observations along the line (location is specified using the
                        <a href="../../information/surveycor.html" target="_blank">client specified survey coordinates</a>).
                        The second gives the time at which the gravity observation at that location was taken, and the
                        third
                        is the gravity observation in
                        <a href="../notes/GravityNotes03Units.htm" target="_blank">mgals</a>.
                        Notice that one position on the line has multiple gravity readings. This position should
                        correspond
                        to the location of your base station.
                        If you requested multiple readings at each station in an effort to reduce reading errors, only a
                        single reading will be listed in the file, because these multiple
                        readings have been averaged for you.

                        There are a number of ways you can estimate the regional gravity anomaly. Probably one of the
                        simplest
                        is to fit some low-order function to the data (say a straight line, or a quadratic function).
                        Then subtract the
                        gravity predicted by this function from the observed gravity values. Another way to estimate the
                        regional gravity
                        anomaly is to use gravity observations from other, more spatially dispersed, gravity surveys.
                        Most areas within
                        the continental US have a complete enough gravity coverage to allow this to be done. The
                        <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">National Geophysical Data
                            Center</a> provides gravity observations from
                        across the US on
                        <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/gravity/" target="_blank">CD-ROM</a>.
                        This data is ideally suited for estimating regional gravity anomalies.
                        For this exercise, we will use gravity observations derived from the CD-ROM to estimate the
                        regional gravity anomaly.
                        <p>
                            Gravity observations from around the city of Golden were used to construct a
                            <a href="../../information/regional.html" target="_blank">map of the regional gravity field</a>
                            around the survey.
                            Using this map, estimate the shape of the regional gravity field along the profile and
                            subtract the contribution of the
                            regional field from your gravity observations as follows:

                                If you do the latter, choose the interval between points so that the approximation

                        In all cases, note that this involves modifying the script, usually by simply replacing a file

        <hr />
            You will submit two reports on the basis of the work described in this
            exercise. The first will cover those questions
            raised in milestone <i>1</i> listed above, and the second will cover those listed in milestone <i>2</i>.
            In this sense, the first report represents a preliminary report of work in progress to the client, the
            second report
            will represent the final result of your efforts.
            Each report should be in the form of a summary report to your
            client. The heading can be in standard memo format. Each should include:
        <br /><br />
        <ul class="square">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                A brief review of the basis for the survey design (statement of the problem),
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px"> A summary of the data-processing and interpretation procedures (you may
                want to refer to a flow
                chart in the appendices), and
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px"> A clear and concise statement of your preliminary interpretation and an
                indication of the action
                that will be required to refine and validate that interpretation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        
            As usual, the body of each report must be no longer than two pages. However, it is important to provide
            enough information (in the appendices) for the client's geophysical staff or consultant to be able to check
            any of your work. This would include:
        <br /><br />
        <ul class="square">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                A tabulation of the field data,
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                A description of each processing step, including formulas and outcomes,
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                For any "standard" corrections that were not done, a description of how they normally would have
                been done and an explanation of why they were not necessary in this case,
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                A narrative discussion of how and why you chose the "possible" models for each anomaly, and
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                A description of any other anomalies that the survey turned up that could not be caused by a mine
                tunnel.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            As always, remember that your reports are also sales documents; in this case, instead of selling your
            services, it is selling your competence and the quality of your work. Also remember that your clients are
            busy executives that probably are out of touch with the technical state of
            the art. Your report must communicate
            quickly and effectively and should convey a sense of competence
            and professionalism.
