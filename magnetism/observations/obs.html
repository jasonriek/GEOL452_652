        <h2>Introduction and Statement of Problem</h2>
        <p>
            As is the case in designing a gravity survey, in
            designing a magnetic survey for a particular application, there are several design
            parameters that must be chosen or known: magnetic station spacing, location of the
            base station, and the level of
            reading error inherent to the basic observations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike gravimeters, modern magnetometers do not rely on an operator to read or
            interpolate a dial reading and are relatively insensitive to instrument orientation.
            Rather, the measured magnetic field strength is displayed
            digitally or is directly recorded on a field computer. The proton-precession magnetometer typically
            used in exploration surveys has an inherent reading accuracy of about 0.1 nT. For
            high resolution work, instruments with a reading accuracy of 0.01 nT are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the absolute accuracy of the magnetometers is well within the range needed for
            typical exploration work, magnetic surveys can be plagued by a variety of temporally and
            spatially varying noises. For example, man-made structures can generate significant magnetic
            fields that are obviously not related to subsurface geology. These structures can include
            power lines, bridges, fences, buildings, cars, etc. If possible, magnetic surveys should
            be conducted away from these features. In addition, the magnetometer operator can produce
            a measurable magnetic field. As such, the operator can not wear any magnetic material: belt buckles,
            wire-rimmed glasses, watches, etc.
            If the proper precautions are taken, and the site well-chosen, the accuracy of magnetic field
            observations can be reduced to about 1 nT.
        </p>
      
            <img src="magtime.gif" class="center text"/>
       
        <p>
            Like gravity measurements, magnetic measurements are time variable. That is, repeated observations
            made at a given site vary with time.
            The time variations of importance in exploration surveys are due mostly to external,
            solar-controlled phenomena.
            These variations tend to show a diurnal period, like the tidal variations affecting our gravity
            observations, with an amplitude of about 25 nT.
            Unlike the tidal variations, however, variations in the strength of the magnetic field can
            oscillate rapidly and unpredictably.
            An example of the magnetic field variations observed in Boulder, Colorado is shown
            above. This example illustrates the field variations that can be expected on a relatively
            noisy day.
            Large, external magnetic distrubances, known as magnetic storms, can cause even more erratic
            variations and in some instances interrupt radio, television, and satellite communications.
            During times of magnetic storms, all exploration magnetic surveys should be terminated.
            <a href="ftp://sunone.geolab.emr.ca/pub/forecast/forecast.txt">Magnetic storm forecasts</a>
            are available. These forecasts are updated 15 minutes past the hour, every hour.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this exercise we will focus on examining the temporal variations of the magnetic field and on
            developing strategies for dealing with this variation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most obvious way of estimating and eliminating these temporal variations is to incorporate
            a base station strategy similar to that employed in
            <a href="../../gravity/notes/GravityNotes16TemporalVariationFieldProcedure.htm">gravity surveying</a>:
            establish a
            base station,
            periodically reoccupy the base station, remove the time-varying component of the
            magnetic field by linearly interpolating between base station reoccupation intervals.
            In using this strategy, time reoccupation interval will be critically important to successfully
            removing the time varying component of the magnetic field. Unlike the time varying component
            of the gravity field, however, the magnetic field can vary rapidly with time, thereby necessitating
            the use of relatively short reoccupation time intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's estimate the optimum reoccupation time interval we would have to use to successfully
            remove the time variable component of the magnetic field.
            Given the necessary reoccupation interval, does it seem reasonable to use this strategy
            of noise elimination, or should we consider a different approach?
        </p>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Base Station Reoccupation Requirements - To complete this portion of the
                exercise you will need to
                download magnetic data to your computer, import it into a spreadsheet, display the input data using the
                spreadsheet's display functions, perform a series of linear interpolations of the data, compute residual
                estimates between the estimated and actual tidal values, and derive an estimate of the optimal base
                station
                reoccupation interval.

        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b>To complete this portion of the exercise perform the following tasks:</b>
        </p>

        <ul class="square">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <a href="2daysmag.dat">Download the magnetic data set to your machine</a> <b style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">(once redirected, right click the page and select "Save as.." to download the csv file)</b>.
                The first column in the data set is the minute at which the observation was made, and the second column
                is the
                absolute magnetic field intensity reading in nT. The first line in the data set is a column label line.
                Columns are tab
                separated.
                Clicking on the highlighted area will create a file with the name <i>2daysmag.dat</i> on your machine.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                Import <i>2daysmag.dat</i> into your favorite spreadsheet.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                Using the graphical features of your spreadsheet, plot the observed magnetic field strength versus time.
                Your plot should resemble the one displayed above.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                Now, determine the effectiveness of a variety of base station reoccupation intervals ranging from 2
                hours
                to 10 minutes.
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Plot the RMS of the residuals versus base station reoccupation interval. This value
                        should decrease with decreasing reoccupation interval.
                    </li>

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Discuss the results.
                        In this discussion remember that magnetometers are relatively inexpensive (~$7,500). Therefore,
                        if your
                        required reoccupation interval is short, it may be more cost effective to use two magnetometers:
                        one
                        for recording your survey observations, and one to continuously record the time-variable
                        component of
                        the
                        gravity field at the base station.
                        <ul class="circle">
                            <li>
                                Using the spreadsheet's mathematical functions, create a third column of data that
                                linearly interpolates
                                the observations between base station reoccupation times. Instead of computing all of
                                the interpolated
                                values between the end points, we will only determine the interpolated value at the
                                midpoint.
                                Usually the interpolation error is greatest at this point.
                                Construct a linear interpolant for the reoccupation interval desired and compute the
                                linearly interpolated value of the magnetic field midway between the interpolation
                                endpoints.
                                Move the end points down one row in the spreadsheet and compute another value.
                                Continue through the entire spreadsheet by pasting this formula down all of column
                                three.
                                These values now represent the time variable component of the magnetic field
                                you would have predicted midway between base station observations recorded at your
                                reoccupation
                                interval.
                                This process will approximate the procedure done in the <a

                                Test how good your predictions are by subtracting the values given in column 3 with the

                                field values given in column 2. Only subtract those values for which you could compute
                                interpolated
                                magnetic observations.
                                You will not be able to compute interpolated values at the beginning or at the end of
                                the spreadsheet
                                using
                                the procedure described above. If your reoccupation interval is appropriate, these
                                residuals should all
                                be small.

                                To compute the root mean square (RMS) residual, do the following: sum the squares of the

                                You need to perform this computation over the entire data set. Choose time lengths and
                                intervals that
                                are representative of the data.

                        <b>Reading and Operator Errors -</b>
                        Like the previous exercise, you will need to
                        download a magnetic data set to your computer, import it into a spreadsheet, display the input
                        data
                        using
                        the
                        spreadsheet's display functions, and compute <i>Standard Deviations</i> of the readings.
                        Most spreadsheets have predefined functions that will compute the standard deviation
                        of a set of readings for you.
                        Unlike RMS, which essentially gives you an average magnitude of a set of
                        readings, standard deviation quantifies the spread of readings about some
                        average. The units on the number given as the standard deviation is the same
                        as the units on the numbers used in computing the standard deviation.

                                This data set is a <i>csv</i> file that can be loaded into your favorite
                                spreadsheet.
                                Its format is, however, more complex than what we've used in the past.
                                Columns in the data set are <i>tab</i> delimited. Choose this option when you load it
                                in.

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The first block of data represents repeated magnetic
                                readings at a base
                                station and several other stations.
                                The operator name, reading location, reading time, and value of the magnetic field (nT)
                                are listed
                                for six

                                along the line. Plot each magnetic profile (the value of the magnetic field at each

                                location) one on

                                Given this reading error, are there any recognizable magnetic anomalies along the

                                The second block of data represents repeated magnetic observations at two different
                                locations.
                                When collecting these observations, the orientation of the magnetometer was varied and
                                the attitude
                                of the
