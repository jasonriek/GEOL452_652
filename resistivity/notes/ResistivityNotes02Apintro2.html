            <h1> Advantages and Disadvantages of Passive and Active Experiments </h1>
  
        <p>
            Shown below is a table listing some of the advantages and disadvantages to both passive and active surveys.
            In reading these, please note that the terms passive and active cover a wide range of geophysical survey
            methods.
            Thus, the listed advantages and disadvantages are by necessity generalized and might not apply to any
            given specific survey.

                    Field operations are generally very time efficient.
                    Thus, passive experiments can be run over wider
                    areas in a more cost-effective manner.

                    Because passive fields are generally the result of integrating anomalous
                    geologic contributions over wide areas, identification of the source of an
                    anomalous reading can be difficult.
