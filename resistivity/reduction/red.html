        <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p>
            This will be your first exposure to the interpretation of data from a survey where
            the source can be controlled to focus on a specific objective.
            In such surveys, the design of the survey is especially important because many (if
            not most) non-geologic sources of error can be eliminated by use of proper instrumentation
            and careful field procedures.
            The accuracy of controlled source data is affected mostly by geologic noise and depends on
            questions such as whether the geology satisfies the theoretical assumptions upon which
            the interpretative process depends.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this exercise, the process will be similar to that used in the previous interpretive
            exercises.
            Once again, the emphasis is on codifying the process, gaining a conceptual understanding
            of the physics, and identifying sources of error.
        </p>
        <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
        <p>
            There are four learning objectives:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Continue to refine your understanding of the interpretative process and the role of
                modeling, validation, and sensitivity analysis,
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop a conceptual understanding of the physical parameters in a resistivity survey
                and how they are related to the data,
            </li>
            <li>
                Gain experience in manual inversion of data in the case where the solution must be
                built from the surface down, and
            </li>
            <li>
                Codify the sources of ambiguity and create rules for the interaction of model
                parameters when inverting resistivity data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To continue with this exercise, you first need to
            <a href="../ACQUISITION/acq.html" target="_blank">generate a resistivity data set using your survey parameters</a>
            and download them to your computer.
        </p>

        <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the gravity and magnetics observations we have collected, the observations derived from
            this controlled source experiment require no additional processing before interpretation.
            We can, therefore, proceed directly to the interpretation process.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With your resistivity observations in hand, download the appropriate interpretation program (below).
                The data file you received should contain two columns.
                The first column contains the potential electrode spacing for Schlumberger soundings or the electrode
                spacing for Wenner soundings, in meters. The second column contains the apparent resistivity computed
                from the voltage, current, and array geometry specified in the survey design or by instrumentation.

                <hr class="gray">
            </li>
            <li>
                Follow the instructions provided in the script to load and plot your resistivity observations.
                In all cases, note that
                this involves modifying the script, usually by simply replacing a file name with one that contains your
                observations.
                Because we have saved information concerning each sounding in separate data files, you will have to load
                and interpret each separately.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may now begin to model the observed apparent resistivity curves. The form of the models you will
                use
                are identical to those you used in designing the resistivity survey; they consist of layered models, two
                layers
                over a halfspace maximum. Thus, you need to adjust layer thicknesses and resistivities to attempt to
                match the observed resistivity soundings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you have found a preferred model(s), estimate the uncertainties in the model parameters. Do this
                by systematically varying the model parameters about your preferred values and find all values that fit the
                observed data to within the data uncertainties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, are there other models that could fit the data equally as well as your preferred model that
                have very different parameters? If these models are geologically plausible, describe what they are and give
                your rationale for choosing a preferred model(s).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>OUTCOMES</h3>
        <p>
            The final report should be in the form of a summary report to your
            client. The heading can be in standard memo format. The summary report should include the following:
        <ul>
            <li> A brief review of the basis for the survey design (statement of the problem),
            <li> A summary of the data acquisition and interpretation procedures (you may want to refer to a flow
                chart in the appendices), and
            <li> A clear and concise statement of your interpretation and an indication of the action
                that will be required to refine and validate that interpretation.
        </ul>
        <p>
            As usual, the body of the report must be no longer than two pages. However, it is important to provide
            enough information (in the appendices) for the client's geophysical staff or consultant to be able to check
            any of your work. This would include:
        <ul>
            <li>A tabulation of the field data,
            <li>A description of the acquisition parameters used, and
            <li>A narrative discussion of how and why you chose the "possible" models for each anomaly.
        </ul>
        <p>
            As always, remember that the your report is also a sales document; in this case, instead of selling your
            services, it is selling your competence and the quality of your work. Also remember that your clients are
            busy executives that probably are out of touch with the technical state of the art. It must communicate
            quickly and effectively, but it also should convey a sense of competence and professionalism.
