            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Unlike the gravity and magnetic surveys we have already conducted, this will be your first
            experience with a <i>controlled source</i> experiment. Until now, you have been mapping
            anomalous variations in the earth's natural fields. For this survey, you will create the electrical
            field (control the source). This approach has both advantages (better control over signal and
            noise) and disadvantages (including cost and complexity).
        </p>
        <p>
            Resistivity also differs from gravity and magnetics surveys in that the phenomenon being measured
            (resistivity) is primarily controlled by the water content rather than by the characteristics of
            the rock itself. This makes it difficult to design surveys for areas where you have no prior
            information about ground water conditions. This survey is a good illustration of that problem. You
            already have some understanding of the subsurface geology based on both the geologic setting
            relative to the Front Range and on your previous surveys, but you have no way of knowing, however,
            whether ground water even exists at the site, much less any evidence for the depth to or gradient
            of the water table. For that reason, ground water projects often start with reconnaissance
            surveys to provide enough information to determine whether more expensive, detailed surveys are
            warranted and to design those surveys more intelligently. This exercise represents one such
            reconnaissance survey, and it will be followed with a request to design another survey if the
            results of this are favorable.
        </p>

        <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <p>
            There are five learning objectives for this project:
        </p>
        <ul class="square">
            <li>Gain additional experience in developing predicted geologic models and estimating
                geophysical parameters,
            </li>
            <li>Continue to practice and refine your structured decision making and survey design skills,</li>
            <li>Develop an understanding of the use of controlled source geophysical methods and how
                they differ from natural source methods,
            </li>
            <li>
                Gain a feel for the source, magnitude, and character of each of the principle forms of
                noise that affect a resistivity survey, and
            </li>
            <li>
                Improve your ability to select optimum survey parameters based on a comparison of expected
                signal strength and noise characteristics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
        <p>
            You are to submit a bid for a reconnaissance resistivity survey to determine whether the igneous
            dike described by previous surveys might be interrupting groundwater flow and creating a subsurface
            <i>pool</i> of water on the up-gradient side as described in the
            <a href="../rfb/rfb.html" target="_blank">Request for Bid</a>.
            You will follow much the same procedure that you used in designing the gravity and magnetic surveys
            (estimate amplitude and frequency of signal and noise, design a survey to enhance the signal and
            minimize the noise at the lowest overall cost, and estimate the cost of the survey). The steps
            to be followed should include the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="square">
            <li>
                Assuming the dike is acting as a subsurface dam, predict a likely range of depths to water
                table for several locations on each side of the dike. Given your general knowledge of the geologic
                structure at the base of the mountains, estimate possible depths to bedrock. Determine the range
                of resistivities that might be found in the alluvium above water table, alluvium below water
                table, and bedrock,
            </li>
            <li>
                Tabulate the sources of noise that will affect the resistivity survey and estimate the amplitude
                of each of these noise sources,
            </li>
            <li>
                Discuss techniques that can be used to minimize the noise from each source, and
            </li>
            <li>
                Using one of the resistivity modeling packages pointed to below, produce synthetic apparent
                resistivity
                curves for the range of depths and resistivities expected. For this survey, you can use one of
                either
                two types of DC resistivity array geometries typically used: Schlumberger or Wenner. Each has its
                own advantages and disadvantages. Choose one array type, and do all of your modeling with that
                type of array. In the USA, Schlumberger arrays are the most common type of array used for problems
                of this type.

                <hr class="gray">
            </li>

            <li>Develop a detailed plan for a survey that can be expected to acquire data sufficient for
                interpretation. Some technical issues to consider include:
                <ul class="circle">

                        Choice of Wenner or Schlumberger array configurations,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Midpoint locations and line orientations for the survey and the range of resistivity curves
                        that are
                        likely
                        to be produced at each location. You may collect as many soundings at different locations
                        and with
                        different
                        orientations as you likes,.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shortest and longest electrode spacing and the number of electrode spacings at which to
                        acquire data per decade in electrode offset. Remember, when planning your survey, the client
                        has not obtained permission for you to operate off of his property. Thus, your surveys must
                        be confined to the site under consideration,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standard deviation of the random noise and the need for multiple readings.
                        Resistivity meters typically used for near-surface exploration are capable of producing
                        about 0.5 amps
                        of current and reading voltages to about 0.01 volts, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Likelihood of reduction or elimination of noise.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                Estimate the cost of the survey you have designed. The economic factors governing the survey
                include:
                <ul class="circle">

                    <li>It takes 30 minutes to lay out the wires and tapes for each sounding,</li>
                    <li>For Schlumberger soundings,
                        it takes 3 minutes to set out the electrodes and 5 seconds to make a single voltage

                    <li>
                        For Wenner soundings,

        <h2>OUTCOMES</h2>
        <p>
            The final report should be in the form of a bid. The heading
            can be in standard memo format. The bid must include survey design parameters, a summary of
            the decision-making process that led to that design (including an estimate of the likelihood that
            the survey will work), a brief discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of a controlled
            source experiment, and a firm statement of total cost. The report must be no longer
            than two pages, but details (flow-chart of the survey design process, tabulation of survey
            design parameters, breakdown of costs, etc.) can be included as appendices.
            Be sure to look at the <a
                href="../rfb/rfb.html" target="_blank">Request for Bid</a> to ensure that you have
            included in your bid everything that the client has requested.
            Remember that the
            bid is a sales document; it should communicate quickly and effectively and should focus on those
            issues that will be of most interest to the client.
