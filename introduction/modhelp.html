<h2>How the materials are organized and, how we use them</h2>
<p>
    This introductory course is divided into four modules, one each on the use of gravity, magnetic, DC resistivity, and
    refraction seismic observations. Each module consists of two main subsections: lecture notes and the interactive
    case study. Each module requires approximately 24 hours for students at CSM to complete.
<p>
    The lecture notes, are presented in a hyper-text manner as a series of short WWW pages complete with graphics and
    links to outside resources. Our implementation allows students to access the material in any of three ways. The
    first, and from our standpoint most preferable, method incorporates the use of hyper-links to the appropriate
    lecture notes directly from the case study. Thus, students can start with the case study and in a relatively
    seamless way, refer to the notes as information is needed to solve the problem. Additionally, the lecture notes are
    indexed on an outline Web page. Using this page, students can browse those notes containing material in which they
    are interested or in which they feel some deficiency. This mechanism is provided mainly for those with some
    background in the material, but who feel a need to review specifics. Finally, students feeling most comfortable in a
    traditional lecture environment can move sequentially through the notes before becoming involved in the case study.
    In principle, this latter method is equivalent to presenting a series of lectures on each geophysical method and
    then doing laboratory exercises to reinforce the concepts described in the notes.
<p>
    To complete each module, students must respond to a request for bid (RFB). The RFB presents a problem to be
    addressed by use of a specific geophysical method. Students are asked to respond to the RFB by submitting a proposal
    that includes a geophysical survey design, a discussion of geophysical noise relevant to the particular survey,
    estimates of the geological sources of signal that would and would not be detected by the survey, and estimates of
    the cost of completing and interpreting data from the survey.
<p>
    In designing their geophysical surveys, students are provided Java-based Web scripts that allow them to model the
    geophysical response over geologic structures relevant to the particular RFB. The modeling script generates
    synthetic observations over simple geological models. Using the forward modeling script and estimates of the cost
    required to perform each step of the survey, students determine optimal survey parameters for the particular
    problem, in the sense of survey resolution versus survey cost. Because the optimal survey is defined in terms of a
    rather nebulous cost-benefit trade-off, different participants rarely define surveys based on the same set of
    parameters. We actively encourage students to try different survey designs. Whatever design chosen, however, it must
    be justified to the hypothetical client in the formal bid that is submitted in response to the RFB.
<p>
    After designing the geophysical survey, the parameters defining each student's survey can be entered into a WWW page
    and students immediately receive a data set that includes random and systematic noises unique to their particular
    survey. Students are then guided through a data-reduction procedure using relatively simple spreadsheet
    manipulations. Upon completing the data reduction, students can finally download a modeling script that allows them
    to interpret their reduced data by superimposing model computations on the data set. A final report is submitted and
    includes their preferred solution, uncertainty estimates, a discussion of other interpretations that could fit the
    geophysical observations and reasons why these other solutions are not preferred.
